# Nvidia CUTLASS: Introduction and Installation Guide

This blog post provides an introduction to two essential NVIDIA GPU-accelerated libraries, **CUTLASS** and **cuBLAS**, along with step-by-step instructions to install and set them up for your projects.

## 1. Nvidia CUTLASS

### 1.1 What is CUTLASS?

**CUTLASS** (CUDA Templates for Linear Algebra Subroutines and Solvers) is a CUDA C++ template library developed by NVIDIA. It is designed for high-performance matrix multiplication (GEMM) and other linear algebra operations. With CUTLASS, developers can leverage NVIDIA GPUs for deep learning, scientific computing, and engineering simulations through highly optimized routines.

### 1.2 Installing CUTLASS

#### Prerequisites

- **CUDA Toolkit** (recommended: CUDA 10.2 or higher)
- **CMake** (recommended: 3.10 or higher)
- A CUDA-capable compiler (e.g., NVIDIA nvcc)

#### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/cutlass.git
   cd cutlass
